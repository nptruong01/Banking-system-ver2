# Banking Transaction Management System Version 2

## Introduction
The Banking Transaction Management System Version 2 is a Java Swing application designed to streamline and manage various banking operations. This system provides a user-friendly interface for customers and employees to perform essential banking tasks securely and efficiently.

## Functionality

### Customer Information Management

#### Add, Delete, and Update
Customers interact with the bank by providing their information through a designated form. Bank employees use this information to manage customer data, including full name, ID number, gender, address, and more.

### Employee Account Management

#### Account Administration
Administrators have access to a master account (Admin) which allows them to create sub-accounts with specific permissions. These sub-accounts are tailored for various tasks within the system.

### Transaction Handling

#### Deposit, Withdrawal, and Money Transfer
Customers can deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds by interacting with bank employees. Transactions are securely processed with appropriate authentication and fund checks.

### Account Inquiries

#### Check Balance and Transaction History
Customers can easily check their account balance and view transaction histories by providing necessary authentication. This allows for transparent and accurate account monitoring.
